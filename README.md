# NetflixEDA

I decided to have a look over the data about the content that Netflix has been using on its platform over the past with the perspective of a consultant to the CEO of Netflix.
The plan was to look at the data and come up with a few actionable suggestions to the CEO that can help them create more value in terms of viewership, brand and revenue.

## Structure

- Distribution of Ratings
- Content on Netflix: TV Series or Movies?
- Genres on Netflix - Sentiment Analysis
- How to make great revenue?
- Relationship between two different ratings and number of awards 
- Is there an ideal run time for a successful movie?
- The most popular directors/actors
