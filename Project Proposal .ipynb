    "Our team picked the Netflix Dataset. The data set contains information about all the content that netflix has on all of its platforms (all countries included). Some of the interesting features of this data include: Title, Genre, Tags, User Ratings, Cast, Revenue, Critic ratings. These are a few of the 26 features of the data. \n",

    "What we noticed as a group is how the recipe for a successful movie changes from region to region. Through our EDA project we would like to explore these differences. The aim of our EDA is to visualize the relationship between these attributes with the perception of the movies (user/critic ratings) and establish some sort of a pattern. \n",

This affinity towards the entertainment sector prompted us to dig deeper into what makes movies a success and how success requires different recipes depending on where we come from (India and China).

    "1. What genres and tags are the most successful with the audiences in different countries?\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Is there a dispersion between the audience and critic ratings for these movies?\n",
    "We can plot the difference in ratings on the X axis and revenue on Y axis. The scatter plot of movies on this graph will allow us to identify the movies that did well in spite of tanking with the critics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are these successful movies (with high user ratings) also making good revenue?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For a particular country, are Netflix originals performing better than the local content?\n",
    "If we filter out the movies that have the same Netflix Release Data and Release Date, we will be able to single out the Netflix originals. Then, for each country we can plot the movies against different success parameters and evaluate a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Does the relationship between critic ratings and awards received standard or varying with countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Is there an ideal run time for a successful movie?\n",

    "7. Is there a correlation between successful movies and the actors and directors involved with it?"
